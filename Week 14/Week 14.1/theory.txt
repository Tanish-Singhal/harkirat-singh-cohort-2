React vs Next
1. In react, frontend and backend have to maintain in seperate folder. While in Next it's not.
2. React does not provide routing out of the box, while nextjs has file based router.
3. React is not SEO optimised.
- not exactly teur today because of React Server Components
4. Waterfalling problem which react have

SEO
- Google has crawlers (which scan the website).
- In react, the initial HTML file does not contain anything. It was JS that put the content in the HTML file afterwards.

Waterfalling
- In React, HTML, CSS, Js comes one after the other. While in NEXT, all the things comes in a single requests.

NEXT offering
1. Server side rendering - Get’s rid of SEO problems
2. API routes - Single codebase with frontend and backend
3. File based routing (no need for react-router-dom)
4. Bundle size optimisations, Static site generation

Downsides
1. Can’t be distributed via a CDN, always needs a server running that does server side rendering and hence is expensive
2. Very opinionated, very hard to move out of it
