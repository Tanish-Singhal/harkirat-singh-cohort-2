when password is stored in a website database, then it directly stored in the website database.

1. Hashing
2. Encryption
3. Json web token
4. Local Storage

TODO: Hashing
Converting the string (email and password) into some gibberish string, so that it can't be decrypt by the hackers easily
same string always converted into same gibberish word. You can only convert into gibberish string, no way to reverse it

TODO: Encryption
Converting the string (email and password) into some gibberish string.
same string always converted into same gibberish word. You can decrypt it by using the key provided for encryption

TODO: Json web token
It only convert Json data into 3 very long random string.
token - when the json data is converted, then anyone can converted that 3 very long string into the json data.
then that data is then verify by the server of the company.

json data    ==>    jwt.encode with password of the jwt    ==>    3 very long string
3 very long string    ==>    jwt.verigy with password of jwt    ==>    json data

TODO: Local Storage
