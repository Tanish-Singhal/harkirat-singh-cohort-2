SQL Database => MySQL
No SQL Database => MongoDB

Mongo DB
Relational Database and Non Relational Database

    Code Side                   Mongo DB Side
1. Database Setup           Database Formation
2. Model                    Collection
3. Schema                   Documents

MongoDb lets you create multiple Database (Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram)
In each DB, it lets you create tables (user info, photo info, video info)
In each table, it lets you dump JSON data
It is schemaless (you don't have to define a structure of your data, you can dump any kind of data)
It scales well

2. The things you made on the left of the comapss is the "DATABASE"
3. Tehe further things you create inside the folder are called "COLLECTIONS/TABLE"
