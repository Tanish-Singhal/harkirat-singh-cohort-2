Types of Database
1. NoSQL Database :- Stores data in a schema-less fashion. Example => MongoDB
2. Graph Database :- Stores data in the form of graph. Specially useful in cases where relationships need to be stored (social network). Example => neo4j
3. Vector Database :- Stores data in the form of vectors. Useful in ML. Example => Pinecone
4. SQL Datbase :- Stores data in the forms of rows. Most full stack applications will use this. Example => MySQL, Postgres


Why not NoSQL?
because it is schemaless, so it is ideal thing to make a project very fast.
as it is schemaless, so you might by mistake put curroupted data your your mongodb Database

-> Can lead to inconsistent database
-> Can cause runtime errors 
-> Is too flexible for an app that needs strictness


Why SQL?
-> Define schema with their Types
-> Strict schema
-> update the schema as application grows



Database URL 
postgresql://username:password@host/database


TODO: Creating a Table (User) :-
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

FIXME: Insert things in table :-
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password)
VALUES ('username_here', 'user@example.com', 'user_password');

FIXME: Update things in the table :-
UPDATE users
SET password = 'new_password'
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

FIXME: Delete things from the Database :-
DELETE FROM users
WHERE id = 1;

FIXME: Select things in the Database :-
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE id = 1;


SQL Injection
; DELETE * FROM users;
