ECMAScript
It is a scripting language specification on which JavaSvript is based.
It serves as the guidlines or the 'rules' for scripting language design.


JavaScript
It is a scripting language not conforms to the ECMAScript specification.


Common Js Browser Engines
Chrome => V8 (C)
Firefox => Spider (C + Rust)


Node Js
Some people take the V8 engines out of the browser and added some Backend things on top to create a new runtime.
It is not a language, It is a runtime


Bun
Node.Js is slow, so some people rewrite the JS runtime for the backend and introduced Bun.
IT is significantly faster runtime.
It is written in Zig language.

HTTP

This to worry about

HTTP (client side)
1. Protocol (HTTP / HTTPS)
2. Address (URL / IP / PORT)
3. Route
4. Headers, Body, Query Params
5. Method

HTTP (server side)
1. Response Headers
2. Response Body
3. Status Code
