Docker Commands

- docker
to check if the docker is installed in the system or not.

- docker images
to see, what all the images we have installed in our docker

- docker ps
to see, what all the images we are currently running in our system

- docker pull mongo
it will pull the image from docker registory.

- docker run mongo
to run the image, but if you don't have to image locally it will automatically pull it from the registory

- docker run -d mongo
if you run the above command without -d, then you have to use another terminal to run other commands. To fix this you can detached the run commands by writing -d.

- docker run -p 27018:27017 mongo
to map the port of the local machine to the image port (local machine port : mongo machine port)

- docker run -d -p 27018:27017 mongo

- docker kill <container_id>
to kill a running container

- docker rmi -f <image_id>
to delete the image from the machine
