Container
- Containers are a way to package and distribute software applications in a way that makes them easy to deploy and run consistently across different environments.
- They allow you to package an application, along with all its dependencies and libraries, into a single unit that can be run on any machine with a container runtime, such as Docker.
- Why container ? = different OS requires different steps and it is extremely hard to keep track of dependencies as project grow


Benefits
- Let you describe you configuration in a single file
- Can run in isolated environments
- Makes Local setup of OS projects a breeze
- Makes installing auxiliary services/DBs easy

Docker
1. Docker Engine - Docker Engine is an open-source containerization technology that allows developers to package applications into container
2. Docker CLI - Terminal
3. Docker Registry - It is similar to github, but it lets you push images rather than sourcecode


Images
- A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.


Images vs Container
- Image is something which you pull from the Docker Registry, and Container is where you run the image
- Image (source code which you pull from github) and Container (the running of the source code on different ports)


Port Mapping
- The container port and the local machine port are different. By port mapping we can connect both local machine and the docker machine port.

docker run -p 27018:27017 mongo
              local mongo
            machine container 
                    port


Dockerfile
- It is a text document that contain all the commands a user could call on the CLI to create an image.

--------------------
FROM node:16-alpine                   // Base Image

WORKDIR /usr/src/app                  // Working directory

COPY package* .
COPY ./prisma .

RUN npm install
RUN npx prisma generate

COPY . .                              // it will copy all the things from the server code to my directory (/app)

RUN npm run build

EPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]         // final command that run when trunning hte container
------------------------

run it 
dockerbuild -t backend_live .
