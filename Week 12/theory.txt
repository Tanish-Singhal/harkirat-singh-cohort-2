TODO: What is connection pool and why we need it ?
- When we delpoy a cloudflare application, then it gets deployed in various machines (server) around the world. 
So by this there are lots of open connection to your database.
That's when connection pool comes into the picture. 

Workers around   -->  connection   -->  Postgres  
  the world      -->    pool            Database

So there is only one open connectionn to our database. All the connection request first go to the connection pool then go to the Database.



TODO: Setup
First we created a cloudflare projects. By running the following command: 
- npm create cloudflare@latest -- cloudflare-connpool

Then we install hono into the project. By running the following command:
- npm install hono

Then we install prisma into the project. By running the following command:
- npm install --save-dev prisma

Then we initialize prisma into our project. By running the following command:
- npx prisma init

Now we migrate our database. By running the following command:
- npx prisma migrate dev --name init

Prisma Accelerate to make the connection pool.
- go to prisma Accelerate website.
- create a new project
- click on Accelerate
- paste the connection string of the original connection string (choose the region of the connection pool near your database server)
- generate the API key

Generally, we store the connection strings in the env file, but in wrangler we store the connection string in wrangler.toml file

- that means, all the environment variable you want to use from the index.ts file or through coding are to be present in the "wrnagler.toml" file
- and all the environment variables you want to use from the CLI are to be present in the ".env" file

Now install the Prisma Accelerate dependency in your project
- npm install @prisma/extension-accelerate

Now generate the client
- npx prisma generate --no-engine

After writing the code in index.ts, login into your cloudflare account for deployment
- npx wrangler whoami
- npm run deploy
