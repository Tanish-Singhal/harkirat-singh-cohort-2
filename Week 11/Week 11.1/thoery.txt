=>  Rent Virtaul Machine
    Put it in auto scale group
    Delpoy it in Kubernetes cluster
=> downsides: take care of how/when to scale
              Base cost still charging if no-one is visiting
              Monitoring various servers to make sure no server is downsides

TODO: Serverless Backend
=> These are also the Backend Cloud Providers. In this developer and operators do not have to worry about the servers.
   Easy Deploy
   Autoscale
   Charge you on a per request basis (if noone is accessing the website, no charging)
=> downsides: More Expensive at scale
              Cold start problem (when noone is accessing the website, then the website server was go into colding state or sleep. When the first user visit the website then the server took some more time to load all the things)
